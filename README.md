This simple plugin was an exercise to practice the clip-path property. With `:hover` the image will alter some opacity and we apply a nice-looking hue-rotate effect.

You only need to call two files:

- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.min.css">`

- `<script src="script.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>`

Both are located inside dist folder.

After that you can use:

```html
<div class="future-image-cover" data-img="image_url.png"></div>
```

### ToDo
- Avoid use JavaScript
- Improve `:hover` effect
